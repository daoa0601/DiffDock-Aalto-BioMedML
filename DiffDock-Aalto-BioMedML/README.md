# CS-E4885 Machine Learning for Biomedicine: Project Repository

This repository contains the project work for the Aalto University course "CS-E4885 Machine Learning for Biomedicine".

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to study, evaluate, and reproduce the results of the paper "DiffDock: Diffusion Steps, Twists, and Turns for Molecular Docking". We will compare its performance against other state-of-the-art and baseline models for molecular docking.
