# CS-E4885 Machine Learning for Biomedicine: Project Repository

This repository contains the project work for the Aalto University course "CS-E4885 Machine Learning for Biomedicine".

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to study, evaluate, and reproduce the results of the paper "DiffDock: Diffusion Steps, Twists, and Turns for Molecular Docking". We will compare its performance against other state-of-the-art and baseline models for molecular docking.

## Folder Descriptions

*   `DiffDock`: This folder contains the original, unmodified source code and data from the DiffDock repository. This will be the main focus of our replication efforts.
*   `DiffDockL`: This folder contains the latest, modified version of the DiffDock code, which is a potential testing avenue for future project work.
*   `project-work`: This folder contains project-related documents, such as the project description, reports, and task lists.
