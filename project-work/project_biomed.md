Project work: 

Each group chooses a scientific paper that presents a new method (algorithm, model, etc.) for a project topic. Each groups chooses their project topic/article based on their own interest. A collection of possible topics/articles will be available on the course web page. Groups can also propose to work on an article that is not on the list (need acceptance from the course organiser). The project work part involves studying the article in detail, testing the machine learning method on selected datasets, and comparing the performance of the method to some baseline methods. 

Oral presentations: 

Each group should prepare a presentation based on the project work. The content of the presentation should roughly follow that of the project report, i.e., introduction and motivation, description the new algorithm/model, short description of the selected datasets and baseline models, and the results. The oral presentations should have length 15 minutes + 5 minutes for questions.

Final report: 

Final report should describe the project work, including a short introduction and motivation, description of the new algorithm, model etc., a description of the selected datasets and baseline methods, as well as the results. Report should be written preferably in LatTeX using Bioinformatics journal (Oxford university press) style. Please use the LaTeX templates offered by the journal and available e.g. via Overleaf. Length of the report should be 6-10 pages. Writing in LateX is recommended. In case you want to use some other program/system, format your document according to the Bioinformatics style. 

Reviewing: 

Review other student's (near final version) project report and provide constructive feedback.
